timed function that works everysecond
    between the functions, player can input a diectional value (left, right)
                                            or rotation(true)
    when function ticks, checks if destination is clear or not
                            if it is, move everypiece, then reset player input
                                        (if don't reset player input 
                                        unwanted moves will hapen)
