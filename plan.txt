grid of 30(row)x20(col)
tetris pieces are colored divs with 0 margin but can have a border
background is black

function that makes the piece move:
    function that checks if next square is valid:
        for every coord in piece:
            currentSquare = MATRIX[coord[0]+1]

            if coord[row] +1 > 20:
                return false (that is, can't move anymore)
            if goingSideways:
                if 0 > coord[col] > 19:
                    return false

            if currentSquare.color != self.color:
                return false (that is, can't move anymore)
            if currentSquare.color == black:
                continue
            if coord in self.coords:
                continue

    for every square in coords:
        coord = black
    for  every square in coords:
        coord + 1 //that is, row// = self.color

timed function that works everysecond
    between the functions, player can input a diectional value (left, right)
                                            or rotation(true)
    when function ticks, checks if destination is clear or not
                            if it is, move everypiece, then reset player input
                                        (if don't reset player input 
                                        unwanted moves will hapen)

when spawn piece, if it is S, must be 1 square lower

function that checks if line must be gone:
    checks every square for a black piece, if it is black, continue
                                           if none is black:

    for every line above it, line == line before it, if ind == 0, continue

function that checks if game is over:
    if nonblacksquare in 0 (other than spawn), if can't spawn
